        TuneTwit
        ~~~~~~~~

A simple bot to post what you're listening to on MPD to Twitter. 

Runs as a daemon. 

Synopsis
tunetwit [-d][-s][-c /path/to/conf.file]
      -d  debug mode, do not daemonize
      -c  specify alternate config file (default is tunetwit.conf in 
          script directory)
      -s  simulate - don't actually tweet anything, just log what we 
          would tweet
      -o  configure OAuth 

INSTALLATION

Make sure you have all the dependencies installed. 

Copy tunetwit and tunetwit.conf.dist to a directory.

Rename tunetwit.conf.dist to tunetwit.conf

Fill in the blanks. You will need to log in at http://dev.twitter.com
and register your application to get values for $consumerkey and 
$consumersecret because Twitter doesn't allow these to be distributed 
with Open Source software :(

Make sure the directory in which tunetwit resides is writable by the 
user it will run as - TuneTwit will create a directory .oauth here to 
store your twitter access tokens.

Make sure the targets of $logFile and $pidFile are writable by the 
user that tunetwit will be run as. By default these go in the same 
directory as tunetwit.

Go to the installation directory and run

>  ./tunetwit -o
  
Follow the instructions. You will need to paste a URL into your
browser, log in to your Twitter account, authorise TuneTwit to post
to it and then enter the PIN which Twitter gives you.

TuneTwit is now ready to go. At first, you may want to run it with 
the -d option to see what's going on.
